# cross-obscure
Quick script written to obscure the grid of a crossword puzzle, giving only the row/column numbers of each clue in order.

# Usage

Very limited in usage and scope.  Currently takes a `.puz` file and writes a `.txt` file containing the clues.

The intent is for it to be built into a standalone `.exe` so that a Windows user can just drag and drop a `.puz` file onto it.

# Dependencies

* [`puzpy`](https://github.com/alexdej/puzpy)
